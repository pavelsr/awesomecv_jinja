# Educational Use

This repository serves educational purposes. One reason for publishing the source code is to demonstrate modern software development practices.

## module features

This repository illustrates modern software development practices. It demonstrates:

- **File operations** — reading and writing files, working with file paths
- **Object-oriented programming** — classes and methods for rendering and compilation
- **Context managers** — using `with` statements for resource management
- **Decorators** — examples like `@pytest.fixture` for test fixtures
- **External command execution** — using `subprocess` to run external tools (e.g., Docker)
- **Version control** — Git usage and best practices
- **Testing** — pytest framework with unit and integration tests
- **AI assistant documentation** — `AGENTS.md` file for AI coding assistants
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADR)** — documented design decisions in `docs/adr/`
- **Prompt examples** — examples of prompts used for code generation
- **Modern package management** — uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) instead of `pip+venv`, [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry), or Conda
- **Modern build system** — uses `uv_build` instead of [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools), [hatchling](https://github.com/pypa/hatchling), [flit](https://github.com/pypa/flit), or Poetry
- **Modern linting** — uses [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for code quality and formatting
- **PyPI README generation** — automated script (`dev/scripts/prepare_readme.py`) that converts relative markdown links to absolute GitHub URLs and adds HTML anchors for headings, ensuring TOC links work correctly on PyPI without broken links (see example of broken TOC links on [pandas PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/#dependencies) where anchor links like `#dependencies` don't work)
- **CLI utility** — command-line interface, best installed via [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
- **AI-generated code** — 100% of the codebase was generated by AI
- **Design patterns** — clear examples of KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), SRP (Single Responsibility Principle), and YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- **Prompt-based development** — some tasks (e.g., adding new templates) are easier to solve with prompts than writing generic scripts for all templates
- **Real-world problem** — solves an actual need (generating beautiful resumes). The Awesome-CV template, which this project depends on, has over 26,000 stars on GitHub as of 2026, demonstrating the relevance of the problem
